Basic Shopping cart Spring Boot Application.
Used the derby DB to create the DB.
You can download any database and use that. I am using Derby DB(easy to install).
Created the DB PraciseDB and set the same in Application.properly file.
Used the Postman to check the service.
Cart can have N number of products (Product count is suppose to change)
